# OpenMx 2.7.x: Lots of NEWs
* NEW: mxSE Calculate standard errors for arbitrary named entities (free parameters, matrices, algebras) and expressions.
* NEW: mxRun Now gives feedback about optimization progress.
* NEW: Analytic constraint Jacobians can now be provided to MxConstraints (presently with NPSOL only).
* NEW: Constraint diagnostics exported to frontend (NPSOL and SLSQP).
* NEW: omxDefaultComputePlan()
* CHANGE: CSOLNP is now the default optimizer.
	* Change this with mxOption(NULL, "Default optimizer", "CSOLNP|NPSOL|SLSQP")
	* NPSOL is available from the custom build at http://openmx.ssri.psu.edu/installing-openmx 
* SPEEDUP: In many cases, continuous data now evaluated as fast as covariance data instead of being much slower (SEM models including RAM and LISREL).
* SPEEDUP: F (means) matrix is optimised more efficiently.
* SPEEDUP: Evaluation of the GREML fitfunction's derivatives is now faster.
* IMPROVED: Error reporting is improved!
* IMPROVED: mxGenerateData can now take a data.frame instead of a model (returns data based on a saturated multivariate Gaussian model).
* IMPROVED: mxGenerateData now succeeds for joint ordinal and continuous data.
* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: mxGenerateData by default now approximates the missingness pattern of the original data. This can be turned off with use.miss=FALSE to get the previous behavior.
* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: mxFactorScores now asks user to specify the minimum number of values not NA in order to generate a score for a row.
* IMPROVED: Confidence interval diagnostics. See summary(..., verbose = TRUE).
* IMPROVED: Dynamically balance work between threads using empirical elapsed times when evaluating raw data in a row-wise parallel manner.
* IMPROVED: Continuous time state space models now allow non-invertible ("drift" or "dynamics") A matrices.
* IMPROVED: SLSQP now ignores inactive equality constraints and correctly report when inequality constraints cannot be satisfied.
* IMPROVED: mxCI() Wu & Neale (2012) adjustment for parameters with upper or lower bounds. 
	* Use mxCI(..., boundAdj = FALSE) to disable the adjustment.
* FIXED: mxRefModels Now handles models with one data variable.
* FIXED: mxTryHard Now no longer computes the Hessian and standard errors when there are MxConstraints in the model, which makes its behavior consistent with mxRun().
* NEW: Functions now usable in MxAlgebras: dchisq(), pchisq(), dbinom(), pbinom(), dcauchy(), pcauchy().
* IMPROVED: better man pages for mxOption() and mxComputeGradientDescent().
* FIXED: bug with omxSetParameters() when matrix has condensed slots.
* FIXED: Some functions now respect locally set mxOptions, when previously they would ignore them.

# OpenMx 2.6.9
* UPDATED: Stan header compatibility.

# OpenMx 2.6.8
* IMPROVED: Under the hood changes.

# OpenMx 2.6.7
* CHANGED: Default number of threads = 2. Previously OpenMx used (number of cores - 1)
	* This was done to reduce test-server burden for CRAN.
	* You can set threads using mxOption(NULL, "Number of Threads", cores)
	* nb: multithreading supported on Linux and the OpenMx Team's build for Mac OS X.
* NEW: SLSQP multithreading to evaluate the numerical gradient.
	* Use mxFitFunctionML(..., rowwiseParallel = FALSE).
	* By default with raw data mxFitFunctionML() parallelizes evaluation of the row likelihoods not the gradients.
* NEW: mxOption, "Parallel diagnostics". Set to "Yes", OpenMx provides diagnostic messages about the use of multiple threads.
* NEW: Functions dnbinom(), pnbinom(), dpois(), and ppois() (from the stats package) are now usable in MxAlgebras.
* IMPROVED: CSOLNP optimizer better at calculating CIs.
* IMPROVED: It is now possible to augment the GREML fit-function with an arbitrary scalar-valued function, to be evaluated and added to the fit function value. This can be used to regularize model-fitting with a prior log likelihood.
* IMPROVED: GREML fit function can also use analytic derivatives of the augmentation function.
* IMPROVED: mxRestore() now behaves correctly with argument strict = TRUE.
* FIXED: A subtle bug in the GREML fit function has been repaired.
	* Under certain circumstances, this bug caused analytic derivatives of the covariance matrix to fail to be recalculated after changes in the values of the free parameters upon which they depend.

# OpenMx 2.5.2
* NEW: mxFactorScores() enables regression factor-score estimates for RAM models!

* NEW: functions in MxAlgebras:
	1. inverse trigonometric functions
	2. inverse hyperbolic functions
	3. logp2z() (standard-normal quantile function from log probabilities)
	4. lgamma1p() (accurate lgamma(x+1) for small x)
	5. Bessel functions, dbeta() pbeta()
* FIXED: Two mxGREMLDataHandler() behavior when blockByPheno = FALSE.
* FIXED: mxGREML automated handling of missing data when derivatives of the 'V' matrix are MxAlgebras.

* IMPROVED: Several help pages have been updated, clarified, and made more complete.
* IMPROVED: Internal interface with NPSOL ensures optimizer consistently respects the "Major iterations" option.
* IMPROVED: Newton-Raphson optimizer handles encounters with parameter bounds less likely to cause convergence failure
* IMPROVED: mxGenerateData() now works with continuous-time state-space models.

	* If latent mean != 0, the scores must be shifted manually.
