The goal of pkgdown is to make it easy to make an elegant and useful package website with a minimum of work. You can get a basic website up and running in just a couple of minutes:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Run once to configure package to use pkgdown
usethis::use_pkgdown()
# Run to build the website
pkgdown::build_site()
```

While you'll get a decent website without any additional work, if you want a website that really pops, you'll need read the rest of this vignette. It works through the main components of a pkgdown website:

1. Metadata
1. Home page
1. Function reference
1. Articles
1. News

## Metadata

You can override pkgdown's defaults with a YAML file called `_pkgdown.yml`[^other-locations]. Options that affect the entire site are documented in `build_site()` and include:

*   A [`bootswatch`](https://bootswatch.com) theme that affects the overall
    appearance of the whole site. 
    ```yaml
    template:
      params:
        bootswatch: cerulean
    ```

*   A google analytics user ID if you want to track the people who are using your
    site

    ```yaml
    template:
      params:
        ganalytics: UA-000000-01
    ```

*   Package search, as described in `vignette("search")`.

This also allows you to control the default navbar.

[^other-locations]: You can also put it in `pkgdown/_pkgdown.yml` if you want to keep the package root clutter free, or in `inst/_pkgdown.yml` if you want to make it available when your package is installed.

## Home page

The contents of home page is automatically generated from `index.md` or `README.md`. pkgdown tries them in order, so if you want a different display for GitHub and pkgdown, you can provide both files. The homepage also includes a sidebar full of useful links; see `?build_home` for how these are generated and how you can customise them.

## Reference

pkgdown creates a function reference in `reference/` that includes one page for each `.Rd` help topic in `man/`. The translation of individual help topics from Rd to HTML is generally straightforward, but there are a couple of things you should bear in mind:

* pkgdown does it's best to autolink all references to help topics and 
  articles described in `vignette("linking")`.
  
* pkgdown executes all examples, inserting the rendered results in the 
  generated HTML files.

By default, pkgdown generates a reference index is just an alphabetically-ordered list of functions. The index is more useful with human curation because functions can be grouped and described in categories. To override the default, provide a `reference` field in `_pkgdown.yml`. The `reference` should be an array of objects containing `title`, `desc` (description), and list of `contents`. Since common prefix and suffixes are often used for functional grouping, you can use the functions `starts_with()` and `ends_with()` to automatically include all functions with a common prefix or suffix. To match more complex patterns, use `matches()` with a regular expression.

```yaml
reference:
  - title: "Connecting to Spark"
    desc: >
      Functions for installing Spark components and managing
      connections to Spark
    contents: 
      - spark_config
      - spark_connect
      - spark_disconnect
      - spark_install
      - spark_log
  - title: "Reading and Writing Data"
    desc: "Functions for reading and writing Spark DataFrames."
    contents:
      - starts_with("spark_read")
      - starts_with("spark_write")
      - matches("saveload")
```

The objects in `reference` can also contain a list of targets to `exclude`, which allow you to exclude unwanted topics included via `contents`. See complete details in `?build_reference`.

While working on the reference index you might want to run `build_reference_index()` instead of `build_site()`; that will considerably reduce your iteration time.

## Articles

pkgdown will automatically build all vignettes found in `vignettes`, translating them to HTML files in `ariticles/`. Due to the way that pkgdown has to integrate RMarkdown generated HTML with its own HTML, relatively little control is available over the output format.

If you want to include an article on the website but not in the package (e.g., because it's large), you can either place it in a subdirectory of `vignettes/` or add it to `.Rbuildignore` (and make sure that there's  no `vignettes:` section in the yaml header). In the extreme case where you want to produce only articles but not vignettes, you should add the complete `vignettes/` directory to `.Rbuildignore` and ensure that DESCRIPTION does not have a `VignetteBuilder` field.

More details can be found in `?build_articles`.

## News

If `NEWS.md` is present, it will be rendered into a single-page Changelog based on markdown level headings. pkgdown assumes your `NEWS.md` is formatted using level one headings (`#`) to specify package name and version number, and level two headings (`##`) to provide topical organization for each release.

```yaml
# pkgdown 1.1.0

## Bug Fixes

* Lots of them

# pkgdown 1.0.0

* This is the first release of pkgdown.
```

See more suggestions for writing news bullets in the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html). 

If you have a large `NEWS.md` and want to create one page per release, you can create a multi-page change log by configuring the `_pkgdown.yml`:

```yaml
news:
- one_page: false
```

In this case the `NEWS.md` is broken up by the version specified in the level one headings. Each version will be rendered to `news/`, with one page per minor release, so that `2.2.0`, `2.2.1`, and `2.2.2` are all described on a single page.

If you want to provide detailed release notes aimed at teaching people about the new features, you can put these in e.g., `vignettes/news` and customise the navbar. See an example of this strategy in action for [readxl](https://github.com/tidyverse/readxl/blob/master/_pkgdown.yml).

```yaml
navbar:
  - text: News
    menu:
    - text: "Blog posts"
    - text: "Version 1.1.0"
      href: https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/04/readxl-1-1-0/
    - text: "------------------"
    - text: "Change log"
      href: news/index.html
```

See complete details in `?build_news`.

## Publishing

The easiest way to publish your website is to use GitHub [`docs/` directory][docs] support. If you want to build and publish your packge automatically with travis, see the instructions in `?usethis::use_pkgdown_travis()`.

## Promoting

Once your finalized site is built and published on the web, you should publicize its URL in a few places:

1. The `URL` field of your package `DESCRIPTION`, alongside a link to 
    its source:

    ```
    URL: https://pkgdown.r-lib.org, https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown
    ```

1. Your repository description on GitHub.

1. On Twitter (make sure to include `#rstats`).
