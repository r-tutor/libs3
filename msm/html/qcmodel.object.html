<h2>Developer documentation: model for covariates on transition intensities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A list representing the model for covariates on transition intensities</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table summary="R valueblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>npars</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of covariate effect parameters.  This is defined as the
number of covariates on intensities (with factors expanded as contrasts) multiplied
by the number of allowed transitions in the model.
</p>
<p>Note if
<code><a href="msm.html">msm</a></code> was called with <code>covariates</code> set to a list of
different covariates for different intensities, then this will
include covariate effects that are implicitly defined as zero by
this list.  The information in
<code><a href="paramdata.object.html">paramdata</a></code> objects
can be used to identify wich ones are fixed at zero.
</p>
<p>This also includes any <code>timeperiod</code> covariates in a
time-inhomogeneous model defined by the <code>pci</code> option to <code><a href="msm.html">msm</a></code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ndpars</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of distinct covariate effect parameters, as
<code>npars</code>, but after any equality constraints have been applied.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ncovs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of covariates on intensities, with factors
expanded as contrasts.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>constr</code></td>
<td>
<p>List of equality constraints on these covariate effects,
as supplied in the <code>constraint</code> argument to <code><a href="msm.html">msm</a></code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>covlabels</code></td>
<td>
<p>Names / labels of these covariates in the model
matrix (see <code><a href="model.frame.msm.html">model.matrix.msm</a></code>).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>inits</code></td>
<td>
<p>Initial values for these covariate effects, as a vector
formed from the <code>covinits</code> list supplied to <code><a href="msm.html">msm</a></code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>covmeans</code></td>
<td>
<p>Means of these covariates in the data (excluding data
not required to fit the model, such as observations with missing data
in other elements or subjects' last observations).  This includes
means of 0/1 factor contrasts as
well as continuous covariates (for
historic reasons, which may not be sensible).</p>
