<h2>Parsed Descriptive Play-by-Play Function for a Full Season</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function outputs all plays of an entire season in one dataframe.  
It calls the game_play_by_play function and applies it over every 
game in the season by extracting each game ID and url in the specified season.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
season_play_by_play(Season)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>Season</code></td>
<td>
<p>(numeric) A 4-digit year corresponding to an NFL season of 
interest</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function calls the extracting_gameids, 
proper_jsonurl_formatting, and game_play_by_play to aggregate all the plays 
from a given season.  This dataframe is prime for use with the dplyr and 
plyr packages.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A dataframe contains all the play-by-play information for a single
season.  This includes all the 99 variables collected in our 
game_play_by_play function (see documentation for game_play_by_play for
details) and a column for the Season.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
# Play-by-play data from all games in 2010
pbp.data.2010 &lt;- season_play_by_play(2010)

# Looking at all Pittsburgh Steelers offensive plays 
subset(pbp.data.2010, posteam = "PIT")
