<h2>Scrape an individual game's play-by-play data from NFL.com</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Depending on the year and type of the given game id, this function returns
the play-by-play data available from NFL.com from either JSON (games starting
in 2009) or parsed HTML (regular and post-season games starting in 1998, 
pre-season games starting in 2000). The necessary info regarding the game's 
play-by-play data to be scraped (type and season) is provided by the 
<code><a href="scrape_game_ids.html">scrape_game_ids</a></code> function. In addition to all of the play-level data
provided by the NFL, outputs from the 'nflscrapR' expected points and win 
probability models are also included, allowing an individual to conduct their
own analysis with more advanced football statistics. A detailed description 
of the models methodologies can be found here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998">https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998</a>.
This function acts as a wrapper function for the 
<code><a href="scrape_json_play_by_play.html">scrape_json_play_by_play</a></code> and <code>scrape_html_play_by_play</code> 
functions, deciding which to use depending on the input.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
scrape_game_play_by_play(game_id, type, season, check_url = 1)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>game_id</code></td>
<td>
<p>Ten digit game id (either numeric or character) associated 
with a given NFL game.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>String indicating the type of game, must either be: &quot;pre&quot;, 
&quot;reg&quot;, or &quot;post&quot;. This argument is required for entry to ensure proper 
handling of the type of play-by-play data for the given game.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>season</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric 4-digit year associated with an NFL season for the given
game id.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>check_url</code></td>
<td>
<p>Indicator for whether or not to check if the game's url 
exists (default is 1, meaning yes). This is used to work with the 
<code><a href="scrape_season_play_by_play.html">scrape_season_play_by_play</a></code> function that will perform its own
check prior to scraping individual games.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data frame where each individual row represents a single play in 
the game containing detailed information depending on the availability of 
data for the game. See <code><a href="scrape_json_play_by_play.html">scrape_json_play_by_play</a></code> and 
<code>scrape_html_play_by_play</code> for documentation about the
