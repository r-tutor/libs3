<h2>Scrape season play-by-play for a given NFL season (either pre, regular, or post-season)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Depending on the year and type of the given game id, this function returns
the play-by-play data available from NFL.com from either JSON (games starting
in 2009) or parsed HTML (regular and post-season games starting in 1998, 
pre-season games starting in 2000). The necessary info regarding the game's 
play-by-play data to be scraped (type and season) is provided by the 
<code><a href="scrape_game_ids.html">scrape_game_ids</a></code> function. In addition to all of the play-level data
provided by the NFL, outputs from the 'nflscrapR' expected points and win 
probability models are also included, allowing an individual to conduct their
own analysis with more advanced football statistics. A detailed description 
of the models methodologies can be found here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998">https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998</a>.
This function acts as a wrapper function for calling the 
<code><a href="scrape_game_play_by_play.html">scrape_game_play_by_play</a></code> function over all of the games meeting
the criteria of the user's input.
