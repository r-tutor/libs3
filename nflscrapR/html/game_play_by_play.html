<h2>Parsed Descriptive Play-by-Play Dataset for a Single Game</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function intakes the JSON play-by-play data of a single
game and parses the play description column into individual variables 
allowing the user to segment the game in a variety of different ways for 
model building and analysis.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
game_play_by_play(GameID)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>GameID</code></td>
<td>

given NFL game.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>
