<h2>Scrape an individual game's JSON play-by-play data from NFL.com</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function returns the play-by-play data available from NFL.com's JSON feed 
(for games starting in 2009).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
scrape_json_play_by_play(game_id, check_url = 1)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>game_id</code></td>
<td>
<p>Ten digit game id (either numeric or character) associated 
with a given NFL game.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>check_url</code></td>
<td>
<p>Indicator for whether or not to check if the game's url 
exists (default is 1, meaning yes). This is used to work with the 
<code><a href="scrape_season_play_by_play.html">scrape_season_play_by_play</a></code> function that will perform its own
check prior to scraping individual games.</p>
