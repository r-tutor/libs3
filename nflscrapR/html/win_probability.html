<h2>Win probability function to add win probability columns for the home and 
away teams for each play in the game</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes in the output of the game level play by play
function and returns the same dataframe with six new columns representing the
win probability for the home and away team pre and post snap and win probability
added.  The model used to calculate win probability is a generalized additive
model using the expected score differential, time remaining in game,
also accounting for the timeouts remaining for both teams. Overtime win 
probability is calculated separately using the scoring event probabilities.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
win_probability(dataset)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>dataset</code></td>
<td>
<p>(data.frame object) A data.frame as exported from the 
game_play_by_play function</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The input dataframe with the addition of six win probability columns 
giving the win probability for the possession team, the WPA for each play,
the pre and post win probability for both the home and away teams.
