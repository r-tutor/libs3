This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(iquiz)
library(htmlwidgets)
library(htmltools)
x <- list()
x$question <- "This is a question"

x$answers <- c(1,2,3)

x$correct <- 2

library(markdown)
iquiz:::widget_html(iquiz(x))
#iquiz:::iquiz(x)

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
qest <- "Eleanor scores 680 on the Mathematics part of the SAT. The distribution of SAT scores in a reference population is Normal, with mean 500 and standard deviation 100. Gerald takes the American College Testing (ACT) Mathematics test and scores 27. ACT scores are Normally distributed with mean 18 and standard deviation 6. Assuming that both tests measure the same kind of ability, who did better?

1. _Eleanor_
2. Gerald"
iquiz:::widget_html(iquiz(qest))
#iquiz:::iquiz(qest)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
